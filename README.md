# javascript-app-templates
This is a simple template that can be used for working with JS React projects.  


## Includes:
  * React w/ hooks front end
  * React Router
  * React-Testing Library with Jest
  * Webpack
  * Nodejs express server
  * MVC framework
  * Mongo connection
  * Postgres connection
  * MySQL connection

## TODO: 
  * Backend testing with Mocha & Chai
  * PassportJS example
  * Add new testing libraries to compare between them

## Use as a template
Use this as a template with:
  * git init <directory> --template=<template_directory>

## Branches
* It is best to work just from the main branch.  I don't have the branches completely split, because there is interaction between everything.
  * main - everything
  * filestructure - A basic file structure for an app.  Express server included.
  * react-front-end - component set up, React testing library and jest testing set up
  * server - MVC framework, backend testing
  * database-connection - Database connections set up and an example with example CRUD operations
